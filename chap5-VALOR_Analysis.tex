Keep numu section? Perhaps too much overlap with Rhiannon's stuff.

Plots to include
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spline validation plots + tick table (will need to 'make these look good')
    \item Standard spectra x3
    \item Spectra with error envelopes (will need some work - think this was a pain cos have to force osc params so the osc sample is actually used.)
    \item Spectra (ratios) with various oscillation params ala tech note.
    \item contribution to sensitivity from each detector + detector combos.
    \item Contribution from each systematic group.
    \item Impact of various detector systematics 
    \item Standard exclusion/allowed sensitivities with all systematics (pick some value for the detector syst).
    \item Sensitivities with external limits.
\end{itemize}
